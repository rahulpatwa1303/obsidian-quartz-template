Okay, team! Let's get you two started on a path to becoming stronger, leaner, and healthier together. It's fantastic that you're tackling this as a team – that shared motivation is a powerful tool.

Based on your profiles and goals, I've designed a 4-day split routine focusing on compound movements for overall strength and fat loss, with specific attention to your individual goals. This structure hits major muscle groups twice a week, which is great for both muscle growth and calorie expenditure.

Remember, consistency is key. Form trumps weight every single time, especially when starting. Listen to your bodies, communicate, and let's build some healthy habits!

**1. Introduction & Philosophy**

Welcome! This plan is designed to help you both achieve your fitness goals – fat loss, lean muscle gain, increased strength, and targeted toning – in a sustainable and enjoyable way. We'll focus on:

*   **Compound Exercises:** Multi-joint movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously for maximum efficiency in strength building and calorie burning.
*   **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increasing the challenge over time (more weight, reps, or sets) to stimulate continuous improvement.
*   **Consistency:** Aiming for the scheduled workouts each week is crucial for results.
*   **Proper Form:** Prioritizing technique over lifting heavy to maximize effectiveness and minimize injury risk.

Let's work together to build a stronger, healthier future!

**2. General Guidelines**

*   **Warm-up Routine (5-10 minutes before each workout):**
    *   **Light Cardio:** 3-5 minutes (jogging in place, jumping jacks, brisk walk on treadmill, cycling).
    *   **Dynamic Stretches:**
        *   Arm Circles (forward & backward): 10-15 reps each way.
        *   Leg Swings (forward/backward & side-to-side): 10-15 reps per leg per direction.
        *   Torso Twists: 10-15 reps per side.
        *   Cat-Cow Stretch: 10-15 reps.
        *   Bodyweight Squats: 10-15 reps.
        *   Walking Lunges (optional): 5-10 reps per leg.

*   **Cool-down Routine (5-10 minutes after each workout):**
    *   **Static Stretches (hold each for 20-30 seconds, no bouncing):**
        *   Chest Stretch (doorway or wall)
        *   Triceps Stretch (overhead)
        *   Shoulder Stretch (across body)
        *   Quad Stretch (standing or lying)
        *   Hamstring Stretch (seated or standing)
        *   Glute Stretch (figure-four or pigeon pose)
        *   Calf Stretch (against wall)
        *   Child's Pose (back relaxation)

*   **Sets, Reps, and Rest:**
    *   **Sets:** Generally 3-4 per exercise.
    *   **Reps (Repetitions):**
        *   **Compound Lifts (Squats, Deadlifts, Presses, Rows):** Aim for 6-12 reps. This range is effective for both strength and hypertrophy (muscle growth). Choose a weight where the last 1-2 reps are challenging but doable with good form.
        *   **Isolation/Accessory Lifts (Curls, Extensions, Raises, Core):** Aim for 10-15 reps. Focus on controlled movement and muscle contraction.
    *   **Rest:**
        *   **Compound Lifts:** 60-90 seconds between sets.
        *   **Isolation Lifts:** 45-60 seconds between sets.

*   **Progressive Overload:**
    *   Each week, try to improve slightly. This could mean:
        *   Adding a small amount of weight (e.g., 1-2.5 kg / 2.5-5 lbs).
        *   Doing 1-2 more reps with the same weight.
        *   Completing the same reps/weight with better form or control.
        *   Adding a set (occasionally).
    *   **Keep a log!** Track your weights, sets, and reps to monitor progress.

*   **Nutrition & Hydration Basics:**
    *   **Fat Loss:** Requires a slight calorie deficit. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.
    *   **Muscle Gain/Recovery:** Ensure adequate protein intake (aim for roughly 1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight, distributed throughout the day).
    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially around workouts.

*   **Listening to Your Body:**
    *   Distinguish between muscle soreness (DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) and sharp pain. Soreness is normal, pain is not.
    *   Don't push through pain. If something hurts, stop the exercise and assess.
    *   Rest days are crucial for recovery and muscle growth. Don't skip them!

**3. The Workout Split (4-Day Upper/Lower)**

*   **Day 1:** Upper Body A (Push Emphasis)
*   **Day 2:** Lower Body A (Quad Focus + Core)
*   **Day 3:** Rest or Active Recovery (e.g., 30-45 min walk, light stretching, yoga)
*   **Day 4:** Upper Body B (Pull Emphasis)
*   **Day 5:** Lower Body B (Hinge/Glute Focus + Core)
*   **Day 6:** Rest or Active Recovery
*   **Day 7:** Rest

*(This provides 4 lifting days. If you want a 5th day, add another active recovery session or a very light full-body circuit/mobility work.)*

**Day 6 & 7: Rest or Active Recovery**

**5. Personalized Notes & Tips**

*   **For Both:**
    *   **Communication:** Talk about how exercises feel. Adjust weights based on individual strength. Don't feel pressured to lift the same.
    *   **Form First:** Watch each other's form occasionally (without being overly critical!). Use mirrors. Consider filming yourselves for tricky lifts like squats and deadlifts.
    *   **Patience:** Results take time and consistency. Celebrate small victories (lifting heavier, completing more reps, feeling stronger).
    *   **Recovery:** Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours) and manage stress. This is when your muscles repair and grow.

*   **For Male (6'4", 94kg, IT Pro):**
    *   **Height Considerations:** Longer limbs mean a longer range of motion. This is great but requires extra attention to control, especially at the bottom of squats and deadlifts. Ensure full depth without compromising form. You might need to adjust starting positions (e.g., elevating deadlift bar slightly if flexibility is limited initially).
    *   **Sedentary Job:** Focus on posture during exercises (especially rows, face pulls) to counteract sitting effects. Try to incorporate more movement throughout your workday (stand up, walk breaks).
    *   **Strength/Muscle Goal:** Focus on progressive overload on the compound lifts (Bench, Squat, OHP, Row, Deadlift). Ensure adequate protein intake to support muscle gain.

*   **For Female (5'1", 62kg, Doctor):**
    *   **Height Considerations:** Shorter limbs can be advantageous for leverage in some lifts (e.g., squats). Ensure equipment is adjusted properly (e.g., bench height, machine settings). You might need a step for reaching pull-up bars or setting up some exercises.
    *   **Moderate Activity:** You have a better baseline activity level, but structured strength training is key for your goals. Be mindful of fatigue from work; adjust intensity if needed but try to stay consistent.
    *   **Hip & Core Focus:** Pay extra attention to activating your glutes during hip thrusts, deadlifts, squats, and lunges (squeeze!). Prioritize quality reps on core exercises like planks, leg raises, and Russian twists. Feel the target muscles working.
    *   **Fat Loss Goal:** Consistency with workouts and mindful eating (slight calorie deficit) will be key. Strength training boosts metabolism.
